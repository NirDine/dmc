            <h1>About the campaign</h1>
<p>
There once was a young sailor beloved by the sea. Whenever he sailed, the wind was at his back, the skies cleared and his travels led to nothing but good fortune. Because of this, his crew was a gathering of very superstitious men that thought very highly of the sailor, choosing to believe that his favor was of divine nature. The goddess had fallen for him, they claimed.
    </p><p>
But as all young men do at some point, he fell in love with someone, a romance that lasted for just a few months. For this, his crew was worried, for the sailor had betrayed the sea, and she’s as vengeful as they come. At the first sign of a storm, in a panic, his second in command struck him in the head with an oar. They chained him, stuffed him into a chest with cannon balls as deadweight and threw him overboard, for the sea to claim what was hers.
    </p><p>
They say the sea kept him alive, clinging to what remains of the sailor she once loved. But she doesn’t understand suffering, you see, for if he’s alive down there, he still drowns, forever waiting for someone to open the chest and let him out.

The spirit of <a href="side/people/valtez.html" target="sidebarInfo">Captain Simón Nicolás Valtez</a> has come to enact his vengeance upon those who betrayed him. He drowns every day at sun down, and when he dies, his ghost haunts the members of his former crew. And every morning, he's brought back to life, to his cursed existence.
</p>
    
<p>
   The land has become cursed with the fury of the sea. The tides are treacherous, the rain unforgiving, and the winds savage. Those who died close to the water are brought back every night, slaves to the will of the sea, vestiges of the persons they once were, unable to control their bodies, invading cities at night and killing everything in their wake, searching for what remains of Valtez' crew.

    <p>
Is up to you to rid this land of its curse, either stopping Valtez and his horde of undead or delivering those who wronged him to justice.
